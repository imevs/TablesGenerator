# TablesGenerator
Demo react app that allows filling and copying of table data.
Application is based on Create React App and uses Typescript, CSS Modules, and React Hooks.

# Notes
* CSS Modules approach was used for styles. so BEM style is not really necessary,
    and it was used just for demonstration only at Table component, in real application I would prefer shorter names.
* BEM notation: blockName__elementName_modificator
